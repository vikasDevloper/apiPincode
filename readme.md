You need to create an API calls to perform the following functionalities-
1. Fetch the data from the following URL - "http://data.gov.in/sites/default/files/all_india_pin_code.csv" and save it in MySql.

2. Create a migration file to create the table.

3. Create an GET API for to fetch data from DB with pagination. Display the data in a simple UI.

Use Laravel Lumen framework for creating the said APIs. Push code to git and share with us.


A bit more clarity on the above assignment -

The method is more important than the end result here. The naming convention and other such things don't matter. 

Data processing SHOULD BE done asynchronously and not synchronously (Important).

The data insertion API should check for duplicate record insertion. 

Add GET api for to fetch data and create a blade file to display the data in table format. A simple blade file with tabular data would do. Data should be paginated.

PHP, Mysql could/should be hosted in your local machine. Once the coding is done, kindly share a Git repo so that we can download it and host it on our end.
